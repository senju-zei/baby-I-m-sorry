I just want to say I’m really sorry for what I did. I know I hurt your feelings, and I hate that I made you feel that way. That was never my intention.

I’ve had time to think about everything, and I understand now how my actions affected you. I take full responsibility, and I know I let you down. I get if you’re upset or disappointed in me, you have every right to be.

I care about you so much, and it hurts knowing I’ve caused this distance between us. I miss you, and I miss how we were before this happened.

If you’re willing, I’d really like the chance to make it right and rebuild things between us. I’ll do better, and I’ll be more mindful moving forward.

Again, I’m truly sorry. I hope you can forgive me.</h1>
